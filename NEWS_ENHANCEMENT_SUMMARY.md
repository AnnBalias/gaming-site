# News Section Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the requested news section enhancements, including adding a "See more" button to the main page and creating a dedicated news page with additional articles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Page News Section (`src/components/news.html`)
- **Added "See more" button**: Added a "See more" button positioned to the right below the news cards
- **Fixed element ID**: Changed `news-grid` to `news-list` to match JavaScript expectations
- **Added description ID**: Added `id="news-description"` to the description element for proper JavaScript targeting

### 2. New News Page (`src/news.html`)
- **Created dedicated news page**: New `src/news.html` file with proper HTML structure
- **Header and footer integration**: Uses the same header and footer components as other pages via `@@include` directives
- **Hero section**: Added a hero section with title "Latest News" and descriptive text
- **Full news grid**: News section with `news--page` class to distinguish it from the main page
- **Script integration**: Includes all necessary JavaScript modules for functionality

### 3. Additional News Articles (`src/data.json`)
Added 3 new thematic news articles to complement the existing 3:

#### New Articles:
1. **Mobile Version Coming Soon** (ID: 4)
   - Excerpt: "QuestSagaOnline.com will be available on mobile devices in Q2 2025"
   - Content: Details about mobile version features including touch controls, offline mode, and cross-platform sync
   - Date: 2024-12-28

2. **Community Challenges Launched** (ID: 5)
   - Excerpt: "New weekly challenges with leaderboards and rewards"
   - Content: Information about weekly themed challenges, special song selections, and exclusive rewards
   - Date: 2024-12-20

3. **Partnership with Music Artists** (ID: 6)
   - Excerpt: "Exclusive tracks from popular artists coming to QuestSagaOnline.com"
   - Content: Announcement about artist partnerships, exclusive tracks, and limited-time content
   - Date: 2024-12-15

### 4. JavaScript Logic Update (`src/js/data/main.js`)
- **Smart article display**: Modified `renderNews()` function to show only 3 articles on the main page and all 6 articles on the dedicated news page
- **Page detection**: Added logic to detect if the page has the `news--page` class to determine display behavior
- **Consistent rendering**: Maintains the same rendering logic for both pages while adapting the number of articles shown

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── news.html (updated with "See more" button)
├── news.html (new dedicated news page)
├── data.json (updated with 3 new articles)
└── js/data/main.js (updated renderNews function)
```

### Build Process
- All changes are processed through the existing Gulp build system

- CSS styles are compiled and minified

### Navigation
- Main page shows 3 news articles with a "See more" button

- Both pages maintain consistent header and footer navigation

## Testing
